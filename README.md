Asynchronous Python client for BSBLan.

## About

This package allows you to control and monitor an BSBLan device
programmatically. It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to automate
the behavior of [BSBLan][bsblanmodule].

## Installation

```bash
pip install python-bsblan
```

## Usage

```python
# pylint: disable=W0621
"""Asynchronous Python client for BSBLan."""

import asyncio
import os

from bsblan import BSBLAN, BSBLANConfig, Device, Info, Sensor, State, StaticState


async def print_state(state: State) -> None:
    """Print the current state of the BSBLan device."""
    print(f"HVAC Action: {state.hvac_action.desc}")
    print(f"HVAC Mode: {state.hvac_mode.desc}")
    print(f"Current Temperature: {state.current_temperature.value}")


async def print_sensor(sensor: Sensor) -> None:
    """Print sensor information from the BSBLan device."""
    print(f"Outside Temperature: {sensor.outside_temperature.value}")


async def print_device_info(device: Device, info: Info) -> None:
    """Print device and general information."""
    print(f"Device Name: {device.name}")
    print(f"Version: {device.version}")
    print(f"Device Identification: {info.device_identification.value}")


async def print_static_state(static_state: StaticState) -> None:
    """Print static state information."""
    print(f"Min Temperature: {static_state.min_temp.value}")
    print(f"Max Temperature: {static_state.max_temp.value}")


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on controlling your BSBLan device.

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.
- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]
- NodeJS 16+ (including NPM)

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
npm install
poetry install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
